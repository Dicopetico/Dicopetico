# Dicopetico

Hi people, my name is Edilan (you can call me Dico üòÅ), I am studying Computer Engineering at Descomplica. I really like technology and I know some languages like C#, Java, JS and Python, but at the moment I am focusing on Python for data analysis. Currently, I work as a service desk and I am looking for a job in the data analysis field.
